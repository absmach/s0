## **Schematic Overview**

The schematic represents the electrical design for interfacing the M.2 E-key compute module. It includes power management, overcurrent and overvoltage protection, and status indication for enhanced reliability.

### **Main Components and Their Functions**

1. **J1 - Input Connector**

   - **Description**: A 2-pin terminal connector. Accepts an input range of `+3.7V to +9V`.
   - **Purpose**: Serves as the primary power input for the circuit, allowing an external DC power source.

2. **F1 - Fuse**

   - **Type**: Inline fuse positioned between the input connector and the circuit.
   - **Purpose**: Protects the circuit from overcurrent conditions by breaking the circuit during fault scenarios.

3. **D2 - Zener Diode (BZT52C12S)**

   - **Description**: A 12V Zener diode connected to the input line.
   - **Purpose**: Protects the circuit from voltage spikes or surges by clamping the voltage to a safe level.

4. **C8 & C9 - Decoupling Capacitors**

   - **Description**: 10ÂµF capacitors positioned across the power supply lines.
   - **Purpose**: Filters noise and stabilizes the power supply, ensuring smooth operation of the M.2 module.

5. **J2 - M.2 Socket (MDT20E03002)**

   - **Description**: A 75-pin socket designed for M.2 E-key modules.
   - **Purpose**: Acts as the interface for the compute module.

6. **U2 - Voltage Regulator (AZ1117H-3.3TRG1)**
   - **Description**: A linear voltage regulator that steps down the input voltage to `+3.3V`.
   - **Purpose**: Provides a stable 3.3V supply to power the M.2 socket and connected components.
